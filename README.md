# Compiled programming language
## Description & Purpose
A set of programs for compiling C-style programming language into virtual processor instructions.

The project consists of three parts:
 - Frontend transforms text file into abstract syntax tree of the program
 - Inverter recreates source code of the program from AST, built by frontend part of the project
 - Backend optimizes the tree and compiles it into text representations of the virtual processor instructions
 - Assembler then transforms the code into binary file, which can be passed as a virtual processor input

The description of programming language standard is still [work in progress].
